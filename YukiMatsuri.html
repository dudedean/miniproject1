                        The Sapporo Snow Festival was begun in 1950, when secondary school understudies constructed a couple of snow statues in Odori Park.
                        It has since formed into an extensive, marketed occasion, including awesome snow and ice designs and pulling in more than
                        two million guests from Japan and over the world.
