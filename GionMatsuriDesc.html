                    Beginning at 9am on 17 July, 23 of the enormous yama and hoko are pulled from their organizing places around the
                    Shijo-Karasama crossing point east along Shijo-dori, at that point north along Kawaramachi-dori,
                    before turning west on Oike-dori. The official endpoint is at the Oike-Karasuma convergence.
                    The parade closes around 11.30am. You can watch the parade anytime along the course.
                    Maybe the most fascinating spots to watch are close to the corners,
                    where you can observe the painstaking process of making these massive floats change direction

                Gion Matsuri's other events are not quite as impressive, but also enjoyable.
                From July 10 to 14 (and from July 18 to 21 for the second procession),
                visitors can watch the assembling of the floats, which is done from scratch and without the use of nails each year.
                The Byobu Matsuri, which coincides with the days of Yoiyama,
                involves local residents opening their front doors and exhibiting family heirlooms to passersby.

                The procession of mikoshi takes place from 18:00 on the 17th, starting at Yasaka Shrine and ending at the Otabisho.
                The event involves carrying the shrine's deity out of the shrine grounds and through the town in a mikoshi,
                a portable shrine, which is set on wooden beams and carried on the shoulders of local men. On the 24th,
                the mikoshi is returned to the shrine.</p>
