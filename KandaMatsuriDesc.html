                In the night prior to the primary parade,
                Shinto ceremonies are held to welcome the spirits of the hallowed place's three divinities into
                three resplendently beautified mikoshi. These portable shrines constitute the most critical piece
                of the parade that happens on Saturday when they are paraded through the boulevards of Kanda, Nihonbashi,
                Otemachi and Akihabara. Going with the mikoshi are around a thousand people, including artists, ministers on stallions,
                and many wearing brilliant customary ensembles.

                The parade leaves Kanda Myojin Shrine at 8:00 in the morning. At around 10:30,

                a short stop is made for petitions at the sanctum's previous grounds close to the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

                The parade proceeds through the Otemachi and Kanda areas before a break for lunch is made around 13:30.

                After the parade resumes, it goes close to the Nihonbashi Bridge and by the Nihonbashi Mitsukoshi retail chain at 16:30.

                Then, continues along Chuo-dori Street through the Akihabara area before coming back to the altar around 19:00.

                It begins at 15:00 from near the Arima Elementary School and continues north to the Kanda Myojin Shrine in around three hours.

            <p>
                On the next day, the exhibition proceeds with mikoshi parades by different neighborhoods in the Kanda and Nihonbashi areas.

                In accordance with custom, each area has a neighborhood gatekeeper divinity (ujigami) who takes care of the group and their families.

                Amid the parades, the ujigami are incidentally housed in mikoshi (compact altars) and strolled through the boulevards to
                favor the neighborhood occupants.

                A good location to catch the activity is at Kanda Myojin Shrine,

                since the vast majority of the mikoshi in the long run advance toward the place of worship. From around 8:00 to 17:30,

                the different neighborhoods with their individual mikoshi alternate to enter the holy place, bringing about avenues brimming with dynamic hues,

                irresistible celebration music and an upbeat climate. A few neighborhoods in the Nihonbashi region don't visit the Kanda Myojin Shrine

                also, rather parade their mikoshi just around their nearby areas.
